# Code Refactor Starter Code 
In this activity, we focus on the accessability of html & css code.
The purpose is to utilize tags that allow for the page to be more accessible to others. 

## Instructions 
The goal is to refactor exisiting code to improve the quality of it without making any noticable changes to the website itself.

*Use tags to replace unsemantic html with sematic html.
*There will be comments thoughout the code that will help illustrate changes done to the existing code. 
*Ensure new tags, classes, or id's changed or added in html are updated in css, in order to retain existing styling of webpage.
*It is important to remember to commit any changes done while trying to refactor the code. A) To not lose content and B) in order to have updated code within GitHub pages. 
*In order to commit new changes done to code, simply open terminal and provide the following commands:
(git add .)
(git status)--> to view content you will push 
(git commit -, "description")--> ensure you add a brief description to the changes you are about to upload 
(git push origin main)
You will now be able to see changes done inside you github!
